#Project 5 - Mea Culpa
<b>Team Members:</b> Qianyun Zhang, Schinria Islam, Eric Ho, Yue Shen Gu, Josh Dillon

This is our final project for a class called Applied Data Science. The motivation behind this project is to help Columbia University students choose the best CS courses offered in Fall 2016 semester. We did some text mining and sentimental analysis on student reviews of CS professors and courses, ranked professors and courses based on sentimental scores, visualized results on a Shiny app, and built an interactive scheduling tool.
